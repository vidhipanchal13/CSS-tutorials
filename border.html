        The development of Android started in 2003 by Android, Inc., which was purchased by Google in 2005.[1] There were at least two internal releases of the software inside Google and the OHA before the beta version was released.[2][3] The beta was released on November 5, 2007,[4][5] while the software development kit (SDK) was released on November 12, 2007.[6] Several public beta versions of the SDK were released.[7] These releases were done through software emulation as physical devices did not exist to test the operating system.......!!!@@###
